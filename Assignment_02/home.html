                        There are beaches of every sort. Some are very exclusive and home to just a few mega resorts frequented by the wealthy. Some beaches are so isolated that only those with significant amounts of time or who can afford extensive transportation costs can reach. Some beaches are geared toward sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll, while other beaches are for showing off hot bodies. Some beaches are for families.
                        Some are for the poor. Some are for sports. Some are simply for relaxation.
